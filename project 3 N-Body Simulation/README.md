# Description

Write a sequential program, an MPI program, a Pthread program, a CUDA program, and an OpenMP program  to simulate an astronomical  *N* -body system, but in two-dimensions.  The bodies are initially at rest.  Their initial positions and masses are to be selected randomly (using a random number generator).  Display the movement of the bodies using xlib or other GUI systems on your computers.
